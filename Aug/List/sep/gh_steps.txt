Yes — you can have deployments triggered from more than one branch in a GitHub-based CD process. GitHub Actions (and other CI/CD tools that integrate with GitHub) support multiple branching strategies and can deploy from multiple branches concurrently or to different environments.

Below I explain the common approaches, show a concrete GitHub Actions example (develop → staging, main → production with approvals), list edge cases and recommendations, and finish with a concise checklist you can copy into your repo.

Ways to deploy from multiple branches
Branch filters in a single workflow:
In GitHub Actions use on: push: branches: [main, develop] (or a glob) and then branch-conditional job steps to route to different environments.
Separate workflows per branch (clean and explicit):
One workflow listens to pushes on develop and deploys staging; another listens to main and deploys production.
Tag-based releases:
Build on push/tag (v*), and create releases which trigger production deploys. Useful for reproducible release artifacts.
Manual or scheduled triggers:
workflow_dispatch allows manual runs from the Actions UI and can include an input to select a branch; scheduled (cron) runs can also check multiple branches.
PR preview deployments:
Deploy temporary preview environments on PRs (on: pull_request) that use the PR branch; common for testing feature branches.
Artifact handoff / promotion:
Build artifact once (from any branch or from CI), store it in Actions artifacts or an external registry, then promote the artifact to staging or prod using a workflow triggered by a different branch or by a manual approval.
Example: GitHub Actions (recommended pattern)
What I'll show:

Two workflows (explicit and simple): one for develop → staging, one for main → production.
Production deploy requires environment protection (review/approval).
Both reuse the same build step pattern and use environment-specific secrets.
Explanation of files to add:

.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml — triggers on pushes to develop.
.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml — triggers on pushes to main and requires environment approval.
Example content (drop into your repo under .github/workflows/):

deploy-staging.yml (push to develop triggers automatic deploy to the staging environment)

triggers: push: branches: [develop]
jobs: build, deploy-staging (uses secrets like STAGING_API_KEY or environment staging)
deploy-production.yml (push to main triggers deploy to production environment)

triggers: push: branches: [main]
jobs: build, deploy-prod (deploy job requires GitHub environment production with required reviewers)
Notes:

Use GitHub Environments (Settings → Environments) to require reviewers or wait timers for production.
Store secrets scoped to environments (staging/production) or repository-level secrets.
Optionally separate build (artifact) workflow and promotion (deploy) workflow to ensure the exact built artifact is promoted.
Concrete YAML examples
(I'll describe them in prose here — add these files under .github/workflows/.)

.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
on: push to develop
jobs:
build: checkout, set up node (or your runtime), install, run tests, build, upload-artifact
deploy: download artifact, deploy (using secret STAGING_API_KEY or environment staging). No approval required typically.
.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
on: push to main
jobs:
build: same as staging (or download a previously built artifact)
deploy: environment: production runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: checkout (or download artifact), deploy using PRODUCTION_API_KEY (stored in environment secrets)
Protect production environment in repo settings requiring reviewers or manual approval.
If you'd like, I can generate these two YAML files exactly for your stack (Node, Python, Docker, Terraform, etc.). Tell me your runtime (Node.js, Docker image push, Kubernetes helm, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure Web App, etc.) and whether you prefer a single workflow with branch conditionals or separate workflows per branch.

Recommendations and edge cases
Prefer explicit mapping: develop → staging, main (or release/*) → production.
Use environment protection rules for production (required reviewers, wait timer).
Branch protection + CI status checks: require green builds before merging to main.
Use artifacts and promote the same artifact to avoid build drift between staging and production.
Tags for production releases: consider tagging commits (v1.2.3) and have production deploys triggered on tags — simplifies auditability.
PR preview environments: use pull_request to deploy ephemeral previews for each PR branch.
Security: scope secrets to environments where possible. Avoid placing production secrets in a workflow that runs on untrusted branches (fork PRs).
If you accept community contributions via PRs from forks, avoid exposing secrets to workflows that run on PRs from forked repos; use environments and required approvals instead.
Quick checklist to implement
 Decide branch → environment mapping (e.g., develop→staging, main→prod).
 Create .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml and .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml.
 Configure GitHub Environments staging and production and add required secrets.
 Set branch protection rules for main (and develop if needed).
 Optionally implement artifact promotion instead of rebuilding in production.
 Add watchers and alerts for failed deploys.
Next steps
If you want, tell me:

Which deployment target you use (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, S3 + CloudFront, Docker Hub + Kubernetes, Azure App Service, DigitalOcean App Platform).
Whether you'd like separate workflows or a single workflow with branching logic.
If you want me to create the exact .github/workflows/*.yml files now for your project; if so I can generate them and show how to wire environment secrets.
If you prefer, I can create the sample YAMLs for a common stack (Node.js deploying a Docker image to AWS ECR + ECS, or a simple static site to S3) right away. Which would you like?


What I'll provide next
Three ready-to-add GitHub Actions workflows:
deploy-staging.yml — triggers on develop and deploys to staging.
deploy-production.yml — triggers on main and deploys to production (environment protection).
deploy-preview.yml — triggers on PRs and feature/* branches to create ephemeral preview deployments per-branch.
Guidance to ensure deployments from different branches don't interfere (resource naming, namespaces, secrets, artifact promotion).
A short installation checklist.
If you want these files applied directly to a repo I can create them; otherwise paste them into .github/workflows/.

1) deploy-staging.yml (develop → staging)
Triggers: push to develop.
Behavior: builds, uploads artifact, deploys to staging environment.
Uses environment-level secrets (scoped to staging) or repository secrets prefixed with STAGING_.
Example (replace deploy step with your deploy command):

on: push: branches: [develop]
jobs:
build: checkout, setup, install, test, build, upload-artifact
deploy-staging: needs: build; download-artifact; run deploy using secrets or environment staging
Key points:

Uses environment: staging (optional) so you can set secrets and approvals there.
Artifact upload avoids rebuild inconsistency if you want to later promote the same artifact.
2) deploy-production.yml (main → production; protected)
Triggers: push to main (or tag push if you prefer).
Behavior: builds and deploys to production environment which is protected by required reviewers or a wait timer.
Use environment: production in the deploy job and store production credentials in that environment (recommended).
Example summary:

on: push: branches: [main]
jobs:
build: same as staging
deploy-prod: needs: build; environment: production; deploy step uses PRODUCTION secrets
Key points:

Protect production environment in repo settings: require reviewers or require workflow approvals.
Consider using tags (push to main creates a tag) if you want immutable release identifiers.
3) deploy-preview.yml (feature branches & PRs → ephemeral preview)
Triggers: pull_request (opened/synchronize/reopened) and push to feature/*.
Behavior: builds, deploys to a per-branch preview environment (naming by branch or PR number), and optionally tears it down on close/merge.
Secrets: do not expose production secrets; use limited preview secrets or a deployment service that supports read-only/test credentials.
Example summary:

on:
pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
push: branches: ['feature/*']
jobs:
build: build & create preview
deploy-preview: uses PR number or branch name to create unique environment (e.g., preview-branch-my-feature or preview-pr-123)
cleanup job runs on PR closed — tears down preview resources
Key points:

Keep preview credentials limited and scoped.
Use branch/PR-specific names and, if deploying to Kubernetes, create separate namespaces per preview to avoid interference.
Measures to ensure "no code checkins interference" between branches
This is crucial to keep branch deployments isolated:

Resource names per-branch

Prefix or suffix deployment resources with branch or PR id: app-<branch>, ns-<pr-123>, site-<branch>-<shortsha>.
For S3/CloudFront: deploy to distinct object prefixes or bucket names per environment (or use separate buckets).
Namespaces / isolated runtime

Kubernetes: create namespace per-branch.
Docker/K8s: use separate services or unique replicas for preview/staging.
Serverless: use stage/alias naming (e.g., myapp-dev, myapp-staging).
Secrets scoping

Use GitHub Environments and environment-scoped secrets for staging and production.
For previews, use lower-privilege secrets or ephemeral credentials created by CI with limited scope.
Artifact isolation/promotion

Build artifact once, store it (artifact, container image with tag), then promote that artifact to other environments so builds aren't different between branches.
Clean up ephemeral environments

Automatically destroy preview environments when PRs are closed to free resources and remove naming collisions.
Permissions and fork PRs

GitHub Actions do not expose secrets to workflows triggered from forked PRs by default. If you need to deploy from forks, implement a manual approval step or a bot that re-runs a workflow in the main repo.
Consistent naming & conventions

Decide a naming schema (branch-pr-<n>, preview-<branch>) and use helper scripts to generate safe DNS-friendly names.
Avoid global singletons

Don’t let branches write to a global DB schema version without migration safeguards; use per-branch db instances or feature toggles.
Sample snippets (copyable)
I'll provide short minimal snippets you can paste into files.

deploy-staging.yml (short form)
Trigger: push: branches: [develop]
Build job: checkout, run tests, build
Deploy job: environment: staging; run deploy command using secrets.STAGING_API_KEY
deploy-production.yml (short form)
Trigger: push: branches: [main]
Build job: same
Deploy job: environment: production (protected); use secrets.PRODUCTION_API_KEY
deploy-preview.yml (short form)
Trigger: pull_request and push on feature/*
Build and Deploy job: create preview-<pr-number> or preview-<branch>
On PR closed: run teardown step to destroy preview
If you'd like, I can now do one of the following:

Generate the full YAML files for a specific stack (Node.js static site to S3, Docker to ECS, or Helm to Kubernetes).
Create the three workflow files directly in a repo (need the repo).
Show complete YAML examples for a generic Docker build + push + deploy flow that you can adapt.
Which option do you want me to do next and which deployment target/stack should I base the examples on?
